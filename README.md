Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Miriam Ferreiro-Pantín and I am a biologist :herb: and bioinformatician :computer:, having also a background in biomedical biotechnology. I am currently seeking employment as a bioinformatician. My years of experience have allowed me to develop professionally in the field of molecular medicine, specifically in genetics, where I have participated in projects for neoantigen prediction, the development of predictive models for cancer patients’ response to treatment, and, most importantly, the search for target mutations that could be actionable with specific drugs. All of this has been achieved using WES or WGS, often combining sequencing data analysis with gene expression data analysis.

While I continue expanding my knowledge, particularly in programming through courses, I am looking for an opportunity to apply and further develop my skills.

To contact me please send me an email to miriam.ferreirop@gmail.com :sparkles:.
