**Bioinformatician | Genomic Analysis | Django Developer**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a biologist turned bioinformatician with background in biomedical biotechnology. My professional experience spans genomics, data analysis, and scientific software development. My work has focused on high-throughput sequencing (WGS, WES, RNA-seq), variant analysis, and the development of computational pipelines and applications that support biomedical research.

Recently, I’ve been contributing to research projects involving:
🔬 Variant and neoantigen analysis for cancer genomics
🧠 Predictive modeling for treatment response 
🗂️ Data integration and APP development (almost Django buta also R Shiny)
💾 Large-scale data processing on HPC systems
📊 Genomic, transcriptomic & epigenomic analyses

I enjoy programming and building reproducible workflows, writing clean and useful code, and collaborating with teams at the intersection of biology and technology. I’m always learning, especially in backend development, data engineering, molecular biology of cancer and modern bioinformatics tooling.

Tech stack: Python · R · Bash · Django · PostgreSQL · Git · HPC/SLURM · Linux · Bioinformatics specific software
