Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Miriam Ferreiro-Pantín and I am a biologist :herb: and bioinformatician :computer:, having also a background in biomedical biotechnology. I am currently a predoctoral student at University of Santiago de Compostela. Specifically I am part of two research groups ONCOMET, that conducts research in translational oncology at the Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), and Genomes & Diseases, that investigates the patterns and mechanisms of genomic variation in different diseases. 

My repositories are:
- [general](https://github.com/mimifp/general): public repository with some pipelines and scripts of interest that I have been developing. 
- tfm_mUC: private repository with all data and scripts that I use to my master thesis project for the Master of Bioinformatics for Health Sciences (MUBICS) in University of A Coruña (UDC). 
- to_team: private and colaborative repository with my colleagues of Translational Oncology Team.
